# Ujumla

Read Apache/Config-General config files in #perl6

## Synopsis

```perl6

use Ujumla;

my $config = Ujumla.new( config => q:to/EIEIO/);
# Some comment
name "something or other"
<Section>
   section-name  whatever
</Section>
EIEO

say $config.get-item('name'); # "something or other"
say $config.get-item('Section', 'section-name'); # "whatever"

```


## Description

This module aims to be able to read those configuration files that can be read
by the Perl 5 module [Config::General](https://metacpan.org/release/Config-General)
which in itself supports a superset of the [Apache httpd configuration syntax](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/configuring.html#syntax).

I haven't named it ```Config::General``` because I wouldn't want to take the name from someone who might
be able to do better and because I don't want to raise the expectation that this is a *port* of the Perl 5
module - the interface and options are likely to differ wildly from that module.  It is instead named for
the first search result for *"Swahili for General"*.


## Installation

Assuming you have a working Rakudo Perl 6 compiler you should be able to install this with *zef* :

    zef install Ujumla

    # Or from a local clone

    zef install .


## Support

If you have any suggestions, complaints or patches please direct them to [Github](https://github.com/jonathanstowe/Ujumla/issues)

The chances are that this won't parse every conceivable configuration file, so if you find something that
you think it should parse but doesn't a failing test case would be much appreciated.
